# RegressionModels
Regression Models Course Project for Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization

This repo currently contains my course project from the Regression Models course in the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization. The models studied in the course included Linear Regression, Multivariate Regression, and Generalized Linear Models.

The project examines relationship between vehicle fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) and transmission (automatic vs manual). The data comes from the mtcars data set in R and all analysis is performed in R. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, model selection and inference on regression coefficients.  


In the future I may add other regression projects of my own to this repo.
