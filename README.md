# RegressionModels
Regression Models Course Project for Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization

This repo will contain my course project (to be completed). The project examines relationship between vehicle fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) and transmission (automatic vs manual). The data comes from the mtcars data set in R and all analysis is performed in R.
 The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, model selection and inference on regression coefficients.
